These are the code friendly wrappers for the configuration structures.

configuration_parsers contains the actual parsing of strictyaml into
comment-retaining dictionary-like structures. Here those structures get parsed
into pydantic models that know what their fields actually are.

This two level structure is maintained so that in some version after SATKIT 1.0
we can implement configuration round tripping with preserved comments.
