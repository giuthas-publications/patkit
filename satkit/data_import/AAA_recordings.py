    Produce an array of Recordings from an AAA export directory.

    Prepare a list of Recording objects from the files exported by AAA
    into the named directory. File existence is tested for,
    and if crucial files are missing from a given recording it will be
    excluded.

    Each recording meta file (.txt, not US.txt) will
    be represented by a Recording object regardless of whether a complete
    set of files was found for the recording. Exclusion is marked with
    recording.excluded rather than not listing the recording. Log
    file will show reasons of exclusion.

    The processed files are
    recording meta: .txt,
    ultrasound meta: US.txt or .param,
    ultrasound: .ult, and
    audio waveform: .wav.

    Additionally these will be added, but missing files are considered
    non-fatal
    TextGrid: .textgrid, and
    avi video: .avi.
