## [Unreleased]

### Added

- SATKIT will soon be available on pypi, probably under the long name:
  speech_articulation_toolkit.
- See [Roadmap](Roadmap.markdown) for an overview of what to expect in 1.0.

## [0.12.0]

### Highlights

- Experimental interactive workflow supported by interface and data
  initialisation being collected into some simple to use functions.

## Added

- Exporting data from modalities for external analysis.
- An example script to run from the interactive interpreter or copy-paste into
  it to get some data loaded and processable in interactive mode.
- Some helpful progress indicators to show how the data loading is going.

## Changed

- A lot of functionality that lived in satkit.py is now in regular satkit
  library functions.

### Removed

- Dismantled the `scripting_interface` submodule.

### Fixed

- Saving and loading works again.

## [0.11.0] 2024-11-20

### Added

- Simulating ultrasound probe rotation (misalignment) by selecting different
  sub-sectors from recorded raw data.
- DistanceMatrices can now be sorted by a list of substrings into or simply by 
  prompt.
  - DistanceMatrices can also specify their own exclusion list in the config.
- Saving the selected frame with metadata so that example frames can be 
  reproduced.
- Saving AggregateImages, DistanceMatrices and the main figure (of the GUI) 
  with metadata.
- Expanded SatGrid (the editable TextGrid extension) to include Points and Point
  Tiers.
- Automatic x limits now work properly in the GUI.

### Bugs

- Displaying exclusion is not quite working with the new feature of exclusion
  working both globally and per metric. This leads to some warnings when trying to
  plot modalities that didn't get calculated. Will be fixed in the future as the
  configuration system gets a makeover.
- When data run config and exclusion are at odds (especially sort) there should
  be an informative message to the user. This too will get better when the
  configuration system gets a makeover.

## [0.10.1] 2024-10-18

### Added

- Added some docstring documentation.

### Fixed

- Removed some tracing that was left from debugging.

## [0.10.0] 2024-10-18

### Highlights

- Diagnosing ultrasound probe alignment is now possible by generating a
  DistanceMatrix of a Session with the metric `mean_squared_error`.

### Added

- Statistic is a new kind of derived data class. It is meant as the base class
  for data that is not time-dependent.
- There are now new abstract base classes that Session, Recording, Statistic, and
  Modality derive from. These are meant for gathering common functionality of the
  four main classes together rather than direct inheritance.
- AggregateImage is a new Statistic and its current only implementation is the
  metric 'mean', which is used to calculate mean images.
- Mean Images are used as the basis of calculating another Statistic: 

### Deprecated

- satkit.py will eventually be removed when running SATKIT will be moved to
  access points. This means SATKIT -- when correctly installed -- will run with
  from the command line with: `satkit [command] [arguments]`.

### Fixed

- AAA ultrasound importer now reads dates both in `%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S` and
  `%Y-%m-%d %I:%M:%S %p`.
- Parsing yaml exclusion lists should now work also when some of the headings
  are empty.
- Added the seaborn package to conda environment satkit-devel to make it work
  properly.

### Known issues

- Saving and loading are currently not functional. While saving seems to work,
  since new data structures like FileInformation etc. are not saved at all, the
  saved files will be unloadable.

## Version 0.9.0

- Simulated data and sensitivity analysis for metrics
  - Two contours for running sensitivity simulations for contour metrics.
  - Perturbation generation for the contours.
  - Functions for running metrics on the simulated data.
  - Lots of plotting routines to look at the results.
  
### Known issues:

- Same as in 0.8.0 plus
- Some perturbation related plotting functions have hard-coded subplot
  divisions because Comparison is not yet sortable.

## Version 0.8.0

- Splines
  - Spline loading from AAA export files.
  - Several spline metrics now work and can be displayed.
  - Splines can be displayed on the ultrasound frame.
- Some updates to clean the code in general.

### Known issues:

- Same as in 0.7.0 plus
- Synchronising spline metrics and splines with ultrasound is currently
  unreliable. This is because the timestamps in spline files have proven to
  have either drift or just inaccuracies and testing why this is so is a job
  for the future. This may eventually be solved just by matching splines with
  ultrasound frames and reporting when that becomes too unreliable.

## Version 0.7.0

- Saving and loading to/from native formats for derived Modalities.
  - Saved data can be loaded on startup or opened afterwards. This means
    derived Modalities don't need to be re-generated every time and switching
    between recording sessions is fast.
  - Metadata of derived Modalities is now saved in human-readable form while
    the numeric data is saved in numpy native formats.
  - Database is also saved in human-readable formats for easy checking of data
    integrity.
  - Opening (ctrl+'o') and saving (ctrl+shift+'s') work in the GUI. Overwrites
    are verified when saving, but the logic of that part may change before 1.0.
    The most obvious alternative to approving overwrites on a file-by-file
    basis alongside the 'Yes to all' option, is to only have the latter.
- Zooming in, out and to all now works with 'i', 'o' and 'a' respectively.

### Known issues:

- ctrl+'i' and ctrl+'a' zoom but ctrl+'o' is bound to opening a recording
  session. The fix will be removing the first two bindings which are
  unintentional.
