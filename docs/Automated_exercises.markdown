# Automated exercises

## Alignment exercises

In version 0.18.0 there is just one working command in the Exercise menu: Run
as exercise. Clicking on it will 'scramble' the TextGrids in the currently open
Session. This means that the boundaries get redistributed equidistantly from
each other. 

After that you can practice aligning the boundaries to what ever data is open. 

Please note, that in 0.18.0, saving the TextGrids overwrites the originals.
This planned to be changed in 0.18.1 to protect the model answer.

There will be further commands enabled in versions 0.18.1 onwards to enable
saving and other things. See the [Changelog](Changelog.markdown#unreleased).
