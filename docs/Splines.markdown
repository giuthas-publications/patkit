# Splines

While PATKIT does not generate splines it can handle them as a Modality. Since
the formats in which splines are saved vary quite a bit, PATKIT needs a helping
hand in understanding how to read the files. This happens in the form of a YAML
(Yet Another Markup Language) file, such as those in the included spline sample
directories.

## Assumptions made about the spline files

Currently the spline files are assumed to consist of possibly a header line
(which will be ignored by PATKIT), and lines that contain first some metadata
for each spline and then the coordinates of the splines points in either
Cartesian or polar coordinates. All values are assumed to be delimited by
tabulators ('\t') unless specified otherwise in the YAML file.

A future version of PATKIT maybe able to read `.spl` files exported by AAA.

## Import configuration files

The file should always be called `csv_spline_import_config.yaml` and follow the
format of the example below. The comments in the file (this is one of the
example ones) explain the role of each parameter.

```yaml
# Single spline file for all recordings (True) or one for each recording
# (False).
single_spline_file: True

# Only one of the following will be in use.
# If a single spline file, what is it called.
spline_file: File003_splines.csv
# If not a single spline, what glob pattern should be used to find the splines.
# E.g. '*.csv'
spline_file_glob: '*.csv'

# Do the files have a header row?
# Please note that possible header row information is ignored.
headers: True

# What delimiter does the file use. If left empty, this defaults to a tabulator.
delimiter: ,

# Either 'polar' or 'Cartesian' 
coordinates: polar

# Are the coordinates interleaved in 
#  interleaved format (True): point1/x point1/y point2/x point2/y
#  or non-interleaved (False): point1/x point2/x ... point1/y point2/y
interleaved_coords: False

# These are listed in order of appearance in the file. 
# Please note that possible header row information is ignored.
# Accepted values:
  # - ignore: marks a column to be ignored, unlike the others below, 
  #   can be used several times
  # - id: used to identify the speaker, 
  #   often contained in a csv field called 'family name'
  # - given names: appended to 'id' if not marked 'ignore'
  # - date and time: dat3 and time of recording
  # - prompt: prompt of recording, used to identify the recording with 'id'
  # - annotation label: optional field containing annotation information
  # - time in recording: timestamp of the frame this spline belongs to
  # - number of spline points: number of sample points in the spline used 
  #   to parse the coordinates and possible confidence information
meta_columns:
  - id
  - date and time
  - time in recording
  - prompt
  - number of spline points

# These will be either interleaved or not as specified by 'interleaved coords'.
# Confidence values are always assumed to be non-interleaved.
# Accepted values: 'r' with 'phi', 'x' with 'y', and 'confidence'
data_columns:
  - r
  - phi
  - confidence
```
